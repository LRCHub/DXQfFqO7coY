Early in the morning
Wake up to a bright blue sky
Lightning comes at any time
To break it down and make it ugly
I know that it's just for me
'Cause no one else can feel or understand
But that's alright because
I can handle all that you throw down

And I hope you find a perfect place
Where skies are beautiful all of the time
It's all that matters, pretty, pretty
And I know that's all you could care about
There's no reason why you can't

It's all about the icing
Nobody cares about what's inside
You could see the outside face
It looks good, it must be great
And I know that's all you could see
What would it matter anyway
'Cause I can see right through
Your pretty, pretty skin today

And I hope you find a perfect place
Where skies are beautiful all of the time
It's all that matters, pretty, pretty
And I know that's all you could care about
There's no reason why you can't

No reason why I should
Try to go on anymore
My reason's all gone
No reason why I should
Try to make excuses to make me feel alright
Excuses call for stupid reasons
I know that it's not much that I can offer right now
Just give me one little second
And I will try my hardest
To make you feel like I'm someone else
