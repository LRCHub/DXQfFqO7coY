There's fire in your touch
Honey in your words
You whisper things
Like I've never heard
Thone gold in your hair
Most precious anywhere
Your lips on mine
Is more than I can bear

Pretty, Pretty
Lives out in the country
Pretty, Pretty
Don't like it in the city
Pretty, Pretty
You shine like a pearl
And you're gonna be my girl
Pretty, Pretty

Lonely for you
It's true I've been blue
I've been down
Workin' in town
Some say I'm wrong
To let this love go on
They can't see

What you mean to me

Pretty, Pretty
Lives out in the country
Pretty, Pretty
I'm leavin' this here city
Pretty, Pretty
You shine like a pearl
And you're gonna be my girl
Pretty, Pretty

You make the stars come out
And you make me shout
With the twinkle
In your eye
You got such style
The sun shines when you smile
And you give me
New life.

Pretty, Pretty
You shine like a pearl
And you're gonna be my girl
Pretty, Pretty
