Wind a spire survey the hours I'm secrets, secrets
Spillin' on the floor
Find a love a just because I need you, so much
Beggin' till I'm poor
Wanting so much more this hurts kid
Strangers find the eyes, just the same

Every time I start
Reachin' out to find you
Loneliness abounds
Pretty, pretty STAR
Only you remind me
That only you can find me, in you
In all I choose

Wait remind my life is mine so many travelers
Carry past the word
Flowers jake the sun afraid I'm blinkin' softly
Wishin' on your name
Wonderin' who to blame next, low this
Crawlin' towards the door, just the same

Every time I start
Reachin' out to find you
Loneliness abounds
Pretty, pretty STAR
Only you remind me
That only love can blind
Every time I start
Emptiness confounds me
Loneliness astounds me
Pretty, pretty STAR
It's me and you
In all I choose

Show me
There's no other
Tell me
I'm your lover
Make me
Wonder who you are to stay
Finish
What you started
Vanquish
Your departed
Others
Wiltin' in the shade

Can I ask where you are tonight?
Do you know where I am right now?
Pretty, pretty STAR
Emptiness surrounds me
Loneliness confounds
Pretty, pretty STAR
Only you remind me
That only love can find
Me
