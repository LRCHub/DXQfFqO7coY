A endly wave each morning starting the day,
Neighbor, next door is only just a footstep away,
Neighbor... you're pretty lucky to be alive,
Hey pretty pretty, you're barely alive man,

Look at me:
Candy coloured clown they call the sandman,
Hey, pretty pretty!
I'll send you straight to hell,
I'll send you love letters like a bullet,
Like a bullet,
I'll send you straight to hell,
Straight to hell!

I'll bring you lipstick kisses,
Forever in dreams, lover!
I'll send you love letters straight from my heart, fucker!
You're pretty lucky to be alive,
Hey pretty pretty, you're barely alive, man,

Look at me:
Candy coloured clown they call the sandman,
Hey, pretty pretty!
I'll send you straight to hell,
I'll send you love letters like a bullet from a gun!
